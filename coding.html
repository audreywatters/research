<h2>Learning to Code</h2>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/mozilla_150.jpg" align="right" style="margin:15px">In the fall of 2011, I wrote a terrific screed about what I saw as the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/10/28/codecademy-and-the-future-of-not-learning-to-code">failures of the popular site Codecademy</a> to help me learn to code. The article stirred a lot of interest (it continues to be one of the most-read posts on Hack Education), and eventually led to a research project that examined what sorts of products and services are available online for helping novice programmers.</p>
