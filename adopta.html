<h2>"Adopt-a"</h2>		
<br />   
<p>In 2015, my partner <a href="http://kinlane.com/2015/08/14/stepping-up-my-open-data-work-with-adoptaagency-thanks-to-knight-foundation-3scale-and-apispark/">Kin Lane</a> received a <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/8/4/22-ideas-win-knight-prototype-fund-support/">Knight Foundation prototype grant</a> for a project he's calling Adopta.Agency. The idea is to build upon President Obama's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment">open data initiative</a> so that federal datasets are actually useful - the data is clean and (ideally) machine-readable.</p>

<p>Adopting datasets strikes me as particularly important when it comes to the Department of Education, which publishes a lot of data, but often in proprietary formats (PDFs or PowerPoint slides or Microsoft Word files) or in strangely formatted spreadsheets with columns and filenames that lack consistency let alone clarity year-over-year.</p>
